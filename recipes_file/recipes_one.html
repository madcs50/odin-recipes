    <h3><strong> INSTRUCTIONS </strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Soak rice noodles in hot water until flexible, 10 to 15 minutes. Occasionally move the noodles around to separate them. Drain the water and cover with a wet paper towel.</li>
        <li>Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, Asian fish sauce, maple syrup, sugar, and water in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil and sesame oil in a wok, or large frying pan, over medium-high heat. Stir-fry shallots, chile peppers, and garlic until shallots are soft, about 2 minutes. Move the mixture around the outside of the pan to create a space and add chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then combine with shallot mixture.</li>
        <li>Add Chinese broccoli stems and stir-fry until tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Chinese broccoli leaves and stir-fry until wilted.</li>
        <li>Add drunken noodle sauce and sliced scallions; mix well and cook until sauce begins to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add soaked rice noodles and toss to coat until noodles have absorbed the sauce and are cooked through, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in Thai basil leaves until wilted. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve.</li>
