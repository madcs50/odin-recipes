                <li>Toast almonds in a saucepan over medium heat until lightly golden.</li>

            <h4><strong>chefs note </strong></h4>
            <em>For the best taste, use a sharp knife for cutting the green onions. 
            If you use a dull knife to cut onions, you'll be crushing instead of cutting, which releases volatile sulfuric compounds and makes the flavor much harsher.</em>
